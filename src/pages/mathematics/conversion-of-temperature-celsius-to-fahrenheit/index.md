## Conversion of Temperature Celsius to Fahrenheit
There are times when you have to convert a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit, probably for educational purposes. However, this may seem a daunting task if you are not familiar with the relation between both the scales. We will see that it's just as easy as putting numbers in a formula and getting the answer.

F = (C * 9 / 5) + 32

or

F = (C * 1.8) + 32

### Terminology
**C:** Temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)

**F:** Temperature in degrees Fahrenheit (°F)

### Some Common Temperatures
**Freezing point of water:** C = 0 °C, F = 32 °F

**Boiling point of water:** C = 100 °C, F = 212 °F

### Some More Examples
1. C = 50 °C, F = 122 °F

2. C = 200 °C, F = 392 °F

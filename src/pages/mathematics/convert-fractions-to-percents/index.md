## Convert Fractions to Percents

Fraction represents part of a whole or more generally, any number of equal parts. For example, 3 / 4 represents 3 equal parts when 4 is the whole. In decimal, it would be 0.75 equal parts when 1 is the whole. To convert a fraction (or a decimal) into percent we just have to find it's equivalent number out of 100. It is as simple as multiplying the fraction (or decimal) by 100.
Percent is denoted by suffixing the symbol "%" to the result.

P = F * 100

### Terminology

**F:** Fraction

**P:** Percent

### Examples

1. **F** = 3 / 4, **P** = (3 / 4) * 100 = **75%**

2. **F** = 1 / 2, **P** = **50%**
